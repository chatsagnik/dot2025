## Install Latex on your system
Install texlive-binextra, texlive-bin, and only required packages from the AUR. 
Do not install texlive-full; this will take an entire day and is not necessary.

## Neovim as your Latex editor
Get the vimtex plugin for neovim.

## PDF viewer
Get zathura-mu-pdf (not zathura) from the AUR.

## TODO
[] Setup autocomplete and LSP.

[] Setup templates.
[] Setup markdown support.
